Amanuel Haile is a upcoming student from Seattle, WA with hopes of becoming a software engineer. Amanuel is a hardoworking and diligent individual who is a pleasure in the workplace. An emerging professional in the Year Up program who communicates well with his fellow peers. An avid listener who always provides great feedback and contributes consistently to class discusions throughout the quarter. His prior experience working at Micrososft and other law firms are transfering well in the form of his soft skills. Amanuel is contantly taking the lead on projects and helping his fellow co-workers. By the end of Year Up program Amanuel should be a much more expereinced coder and with post schooling I believe he will have the neccesary expereince to be a great coder.
